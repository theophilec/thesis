\objectif{Measures of similarity (or dissimilarity) are a key ingredient to many machine learning algorithms. We introduce Diffy, a pairwise dissimilarity measure applicable to a wide range of data spaces, which leverages the data's internal structure to be invariant to diffeomorphisms. We prove that Diffy enjoys properties which make it relevant for theoretical study and practical use. By representing each datum as a function, Diffy is defined as the solution to an optimization problem in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space and can be expressed in closed-form. In practice, it can be efficiently approximated via Nystr√∂m sampling. Empirical experiments support the merits of Diffy.}
