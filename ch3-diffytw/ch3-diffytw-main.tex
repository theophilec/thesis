\objectif{\begin{itemize}
    \item DiffyTW is a divergence specifically designed for comparing functions on $[0,1]$, tailored to represent time-series data.
    \item DiffyTW is provably invariant to a class of smooth reparametrizations, which can be configured depending on the problem. As a by product of the computations, it produces the reparametrization so the functions can be aligned.
    \item DiffyTW enables robust and efficient time-series comparison through its discrete counterpart, while approximately preserving the key invariance properties of DiffyTW.
    \item DiffyTW is differentiable with respect to its inputs, allowing seamless integration into broader machine learning workflows.
    \item We empirically demonstrate and analyze the behavior of DiffyTW on various time-series datasets, highlighting its effectiveness. All code is made publicly available in the \texttt{diffytw} library.
