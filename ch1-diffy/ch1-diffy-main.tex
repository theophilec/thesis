\objectif{\begin{itemize}
    \item Diffy is a divergence defined over functions between general spaces.
    \item Diffy is efficient to compute and is useful for comparing a wide range of data types, including images, videos, and point clouds. Specifically, we demonstrate that Diffy is computable in $O(N^{3/2})$ time with a guaranteed bound on the error of order $O(N^{-1/4})$ (see \cref{theorem:main-theorem}) where $N$ is the number of sample points (e.g. pixels for images) in each image, leveraging Nyström approximation methods.
    \item Diffy is approximately invariant to smooth diffeomorphisms, with level of invariance precisely controlled by a regularization parameter and the parameters of the kernels.
    \item We conduct comprehensive experiments to rigorously analyze the behavior of Diffy in practical applications. All code is made publicly available in the \texttt{diffy} library.

%\objectif{Measures of similarity (or dissimilarity) are a key ingredient to many machine learning algorithms. We introduce Diffy, a pairwise dissimilarity measure applicable to a wide range of data spaces, which leverages the data's internal structure to be invariant to diffeomorphisms. We prove that Diffy enjoys properties which make it relevant for theoretical study and practical use. By representing each datum as a function, Diffy is defined as the solution to an optimization problem in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space and can be expressed in closed-form. In practice, it can be efficiently approximated via Nyström sampling. Empirical experiments support the merits of Diffy.}
